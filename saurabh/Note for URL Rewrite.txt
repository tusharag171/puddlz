When we open profile.php and click on userids, the correct profile opens up but the urls are of form profile.php?userid=2
We want this to be visible as profile.php/anhadmohananey.
What we can currently do with URL Rewrite is that the user goes to profile.php/2 and he is displayed the contents of profile.php?userid=2.

The URL Rewrite in htaccess file can help us redirect 1 url to another. Example: click on puddlz.com/saurabhkirtani and by default puddlz.com/saurabh/profile.php is displayed.
Even this may be manual work unless we can fetch from database.

A workaround may be to go to a blank page first ..wrong
